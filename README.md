# shadowrun-drag-ruler-integration
This module just adds a Shadowrun Speed provider so the movement speeds from the character sheet are used instead of running being twice the walking speed.
To configure go into the Drag Ruler settings and select "Speed Provider Settings"

It also provides the option of automatically applying a Condition Lab condition once the token goes over the "walking" range, and a switch to only apply it to tokens tagged as npc as to not annoy players with it.
