# shadowrun-drag-ruler-integration
This module just adds a shadowrun Speed provider so the movement speeds from the character sheet are used instead of running being twice the walking speed.

It also provides the option of automatically applying a Combat Utility Belt Effect once the token goes over the "walking" range, and a switch to only apply it to tokens tagged as npc
